title: Lido on Ethereum Scorecard
description: Keep track of the latest updates on how Lido is performing against
  its goal of being decentralized, trustless, governance-minimized and
  ethos-aligned with the Ethereum community.
---
Lido started with a mission to keep Ethereum decentralized and to democratize access to staking on the Beacon Chain.

While the protocol specification and related technologies evolve, Lido continues to drive towards its vision of a trustless, governance-minimized, and ethos aligned liquid staking protocol.

The scorecard below shows how we are doing. We invite input and feedback from the Ethereum community to keep track along the way on our [research forum](https://research.lido.fi/). 

## Where we’re already succeeding

While these attributes will remain under review, we assess Lido's performance to be 'Good'. We welcome community feedback on the attributes and how they are scored on our Research Forum.

rows:
  - scorecard-attribute: Legally and physically unrelated
    categories: Validator market
    self-assessment: Needs improvement
  - scorecard-attribute: Lido’s hostile takeover via a hard fork is possible
    categories: Security
    self-assessment: Good
    comments: "As discussed in our\_[The Next Chapter for Lido](https://blog.lido.fi/the-next-chapter-for-lido/)\_article, as a very last resort (in the case of governance capture) we have made it trivial for Ethereum core developers to revoke Lido’s current permissions and transfer them to a community-owned contract."

## Needs Improvement

These attributes clearly need work and Lido is actively working on solutions and improvements. We welcome input from the DAO, our partners and the wider community as we seek solutions

  - scorecard-attribute: Lido governance has significant safeguards

      Currently, the Aragon votes are two-phased. The first phase is regular
      vote, and the second one is time-lock with objections, during which LDO
      holders can only vote 'against' or change their vote from 'for' to
      'against'.
  - scorecard-attribute: There’s a robust set of Lido governance delegates

    self-assessment: Needs improvement

      Lido DAO currently has vote delegation for Snapshot votes; however, the
      delegate set is limited and significant amount of voting power is
      undelegated and dormant.\

      Lido is working on improving the delegate set and educating DAO members
      about vote delegation.
