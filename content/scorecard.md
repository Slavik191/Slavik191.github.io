title: Lido on Ethereum
description: Keep track of the latest updates on how Lido is performing against
  its goal of being decentralized, trustless, governance-minimized and
  ethos-aligned with the Ethereum community.
---
Lido started with a mission to keep Ethereum decentralized and to democratize access to staking on the Beacon Chain.

While the protocol specification and related technologies evolve, Lido continues to drive towards its vision of a trustless, governance-minimized, and ethos aligned liquid staking protocol.

The scorecard below shows how we are doing. We invite input and feedback from the Ethereum community to keep track along the way on our [research forum](https://research.lido.fi/). 

## Where we’re already succeeding

While these attributes will remain under review, we assess Lido's performance to be 'Good'. We welcome community feedback on the attributes and how they are scored on our Research Forum.
